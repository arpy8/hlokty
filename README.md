# Deprecated: `hlokty` Python Package

**Disclaimer:** The `hlokty` library described here is deprecated, and its usage is strongly discouraged. It was created for experimental purposes only and should never be employed for any malicious activities or unauthorized access to personal information. The author of this library does not take any responsibility for any misuse or damage caused by its usage.

## Overview

The `hlokty` Python package was a dubious tool designed to gather system information, IP configurations, WiFi passwords, and other sensitive data by executing an executable file that ran a set of batch commands in the background without user consent. The collected information was then sent via a POST request to a custom-hosted API (utilizing [render](https://render.com/)). Subsequently, a Discord bot was triggered to transfer the received data into a Discord channel.

The package is no longer available, and the PyPI account associated with it has been deleted due to violation of policies (totally deserved, lesson learnt). üôè

## Important Note

It is crucial to emphasize that the `hlokty` package was created for experimental purposes and should never be used for any unethical or harmful activities. Unauthorized access to personal information and the creation of tools for such purposes are both illegal and unethical.
